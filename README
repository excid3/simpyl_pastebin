Simpyl Pastebin

Author: Chris Oliver <excid3@gmail.com>

Usage:
    python manage.py runserver

    The site will be accessbile on http://localhost:8000

    If you have issues with pastebin_paste not existing, run:
    
    python manage.py sql pastebin
    python manage.py syncdb

If the setting SIMPYL_PASTEBIN_ZMQ_URL is set in django, a small text notification will be PUB'd to a SUB socket at the url specified.

If the setting SIMPYL_PASTEBIN_TITLE is set, it'll be the title of the pastebin.

The optional username field will be persisted between pages and sessions if SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN and SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE are set in settings.  The username will be broadcasted with the ZMQ publish.
